## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher (for source code)
- Windows, Linux, or macOS
- **OR use the pre-built executable (no Python required!)**

### Option 1: Pre-built Executable (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/artofscripting/networkvector.git
cd networkvector

# Download the latest executable from Releases tab on GitHub
# Or build it yourself using the instructions below

# Run immediately with no setup required
./nvector.exe 192.168.1.0/24

# All features included: 1000 threads, embedded data, interactive visualization
```

**Note**: Pre-built executables are available in the [Releases section](https://github.com/artofscripting/networkvector/releases) of this repository.

### Option 2: Python Source

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/artofscripting/networkvector.git
cd networkvector

# Install dependencies (none required - uses only Python standard library!)

# Run a basic scan (uses 1000 threads by default for maximum speed)
python src/nvector.py 192.168.1.1

# Scan entire network with full features
python src/nvector.py 192.168.1.0/24 --resolve-hostnames --enumerate-shares

# Use the pre-built executable (no Python required!)
./nvector.exe 192.168.1.0/24
```

### Build Executable (Optional)
```bash
# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Navigate to source directory
cd src

# Build standalone executable with all dependencies
pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "custom_d3_graph.py;." --hidden-import=webbrowser --name="nvector" nvector.py

# Run the executable
./dist/nvector.exe 192.168.1.0/24
```

**Pre-built Executable Available**: A ready-to-use `nvector.exe` is included in the repository for immediate use without Python installation.

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Basic Network Scan
```bash
# Scan a single host (uses 1000 threads by default)
python src/nvector.py 192.168.1.100

# Or use the pre-built executable
./nvector.exe 192.168.1.100

# Scan a network range
python src/nvector.py 192.168.1.0/24
```

### Advanced Scanning
```bash
# Full feature scan with hostname resolution and SMB enumeration (default 1000 threads)
python src/nvector.py 192.168.1.0/24 --resolve-hostnames --enumerate-shares

# Reduce threads for stealth scanning
python src/nvector.py 192.168.1.0/24 --threads 50

# Custom port range
python src/nvector.py 192.168.1.1 --ports 22 80 443 3389 5432

# Custom timeout for slow networks
python src/nvector.py 192.168.1.0/24 --timeout 2.0

# Maximum performance with executable
./nvector.exe 192.168.1.0/24 --threads 1000
```

### Output Options
```bash
# Skip graph generation (console output only)
python src/nvector.py 192.168.1.0/24 --no-graph

# Disable specific features
python src/nvector.py 192.168.1.0/24 --no-resolve-hostnames --no-enumerate-shares
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Ethical Use
- **Educational Purpose** - Designed for learning network security concepts
- **Authorized Testing Only** - Only scan networks you own or have permission to test
- **Responsible Disclosure** - Report vulnerabilities through proper channels

### Detection Avoidance
Network Vector performs basic TCP scanning which may be detected by:
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Firewall logs
- Network monitoring tools

For stealth scanning, consider:
- Reducing thread count (`--threads 1-10`)
- Increasing timeout values (`--timeout 2.0`)
- Scanning during low-traffic periods
